Shady Hacking 1nstrument Makes Machine Enrollment Retreat

Website, source tree, and write-up for a ChromeOS enrollment jailbreak

## What is Shimmer?

Shimmer is an exploit found in the ChromeOS shim kernel that utilitzes modified RMA factory shims to gain code execution at recovery.<br>

For more info, check out the blog post/writeup [here](https://coolelectronics.me/blog/breaking-cros-2)

## How do I use it?

The prebuilt binaries have been taken off of the official mirror (dl.sh1mmer.me), so you'll have to build it from source

Here's how you do that.
First, you need to know your chromebook's board. Go to chrome://version on your chromebook and copy the word after "stable-channel". If chrome://version is blocked, you can search up your chromebook's model name on chrome100.dev and see what board it corresponds to. DO NOT DOWNLOAD ANYTHING FROM CHROME100.DEV AND USE IT WITH THE BUILDER, IT WILL NOT WORK.

If your board name is in the list below, great! Download the RAW shim corresponding to your board from [here](https://files.ultimatesrv.com).

- brask, brya, clapper, coral, dedede, enguarde, glimmer, grunt, hana, hatch, jacuzzi, kukui, nami, octopus, orco, pyro, reks, sentry, stout, strongbad, tidus, ultima, volteer, zork

If it's not, good luck. You'll have to try and call up your OEM and demand the files from them, which they are unlikely to give to you.

### Building a Beautiful World shim

IMPORTANT!!!! IF YOU HAVE EITHER THE `coral` OR `hana` BOARDS, DO NOT FOLLOW THESE INSTRUCTIONS, INSTEAD SKIP TO THE "Building a legacy shim" SECTION

Now we can start building. Type out all of these commands in the terminal. You need to be on linux/wsl2 and have the following packages installed: cgpt, git, wget.
Note that WSL doesn't work for some people, and if you have trouble building it it's recommended to just use a VM or the [web builder](https://sh1mmer.me/builder.html)
**WEB BUILDER DOES NOT INCLUDE PAYLOADS!! YOU MUST BUILD IT MANUALLY FROM SOURCE FOR PAYLOADS**

```
git clone https://github.com/CoolElectronics/sh1mmer
cd sh1mmer/wax
wget https://dl.sh1mmer.me/build-tools/chromebrew/chromebrew.tar.gz
sudo bash wax.sh /path/to/the/shim/you/downloaded.bin
```

When this finishes, the bin file in the path you provided will have been converted into a sh1mmer image. Note that this is a destructive operation, you will need to redownload a fresh shim to try again if it fails.

If you want to build a devshim, replace `chromebrew.tar.gz` with `chromebrew-dev.tar.gz` and add `--dev` to the end of `sudo sh wax.sh /path/to/the/shim/you/downloaded.bin`
Devshim builds will mount a much larger chromebrew partition over /usr/local, allowing you to access a desktop environment and even firefox from within sh1mmer. It's what allowed us to [run doom on a shim](https://coolelectronics.me/blog/static/breaking/doom.jpg).

To install the built .bin file onto a usb, use the chrome recovery tool, balenaetcher, rufus, or any other flasher.

### Building a legacy shim (hana/coral)

The raw shim files for the hana and coral boards were built before graphics support was added into the tty. This makes it impossible for the Beautiful World GUI to work and thus a legacy CLI-only shim must be built.

Type out all of these commands in the terminal. You need to be on linux (legacy CANNOT BE BUILT on WSL) and have the following packages installed: cgpt, git, wget.

```
git clone https://github.com/CoolElectronics/sh1mmer
cd sh1mmer/wax
sudo bash wax_legacy.sh
```

Make sure you have your usb plugged in, this version writes directly to it instead of modifying an image file

## How does it work?

RMA shims are a factory tool allowing certain authorization functions to be is signed, but only
the KERNEL partitions are checked for signatures by the firmware. We can edit the other partitions to our will as long as we remove the forced readonly bit on them.
